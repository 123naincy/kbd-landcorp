    content: `## North India Real Estate Scenario in 2026

The residential real estate sector in 2026 is marked by stability and confidence. Buyers today are more informed and focused on value-driven investments rather than short-term speculation.

Demand remains strong in mid-segment and premium housing, especially in well-planned cities offering infrastructure, employment access, and livability.

This shift has significantly benefited property markets surrounding Chandigarh, where Mohali and Kharar provide metro-level advantages at comparatively lower entry prices.

Infrastructure plays a critical role in Mohali’s success. Airport Road, PR-7, and other arterial routes ensure seamless connectivity to Chandigarh, Panchkula, and Kharar.

Proximity to Chandigarh International Airport adds further appeal for professionals, business owners, and NRIs. Planned metro connectivity and ongoing civic upgrades are strengthening Mohali’s position as a premium residential destination.

Key sectors such as Aerocity, IT City, and Sectors 78–85 remain strong residential zones, while Sectors 97–99 are gaining attention as future growth corridors.

## Kharar Real Estate: Affordable Entry with High Growth Potential

In 2026, Kharar has firmly established itself as more than just an affordable alternative to Mohali. It is now recognised as a high-growth residential market offering strong appreciation potential.

Property prices in Kharar have seen consistent growth, particularly along major road corridors. While prices remain more accessible than Mohali, rising demand and increased developer activity are steadily pushing values upward.

Infrastructure upgrades, highway improvements, and reduced commute times to Mohali and Chandigarh have transformed Kharar’s connectivity.

Government focus on civic amenities and urban planning is gradually reshaping the town into a more organised and livable residential destination.

Kharar also enjoys a strong rental market, supported by professionals, students, and families working across the Tricity region.

Lower acquisition costs and stable rental yields make it attractive for income-focused investors.
